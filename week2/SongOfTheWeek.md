## Lyrics
[Verse 1] <br />
I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the Five and Dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

[Verse 2] <br />
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
Should've known we'd never get far

[Chorus] <br />
Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life
Hey!

[Verse 3] <br />
Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah
See Bryan Adams Live
Get tickets as low as $38

[Chorus] <br />
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

[Refrain] <br />
Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, ohh

[Bridge] <br />
Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no!
Yeah!

[Verse 4] <br />
And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes, when I play that old six-string
Think about you, wonder what went wrong

[Chorus] <br />
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

[Outro] <br />
Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, uh-huh
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah
Me and my baby in a '69, ohh, ho!
It was the summer, summer, summer of '69
Yeah
